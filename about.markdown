### Introduction
Hi, my name's Jonathan and I work as a data analyst out of Seattle, WA. After working in accounting and finance roles for three years out of college, it was a huge milestone to land my first full time data analyst role in June 2021. With my non-technical background, I continue to spend lots of time developing the technical skills required for the role, and I've been fortunate to have such sharp and talented peers, teammates, and mentors to learn, collaborate, and solve challenging problems with. 

### My Experience
**Accounting and Finance:**
My interest in data and automation evolved from spreadsheet-heavy work in my days as an Amazon financial analyst. Much of my time was spent manually building Excel workbooks to provide visibility into huge datasets. This work turned out to be a great foundation in translating data into key storylines using plain English to describe what the findings were, and what the recommendation is, enabling higher accuracy in our financial reporting.

**Data and BI:**
My role as a data analyst at Nordstrom challenged me in many ways. I started small, only dealing with a few ad hoc requests, and eventually became the primary SME for merchandise financial planning data sources and dashboards. Owning this project from start to finish gave me exposure to sprint planning best practices, SQL pipelining, ETL maintenance, Tableau dashboarding, and most importantly - stakeholder engagement. Being a part of such a strong data team and great projects has been the most rewarding part of my career so far.

### Outside of Work
Outside of pursuing a career in data analytics, I enjoy trail running and playing violin. My improvement in these skills require lots of practice, personal growth, and learning from others. The same mindset that helps me stay on top of these hobbies is what makes me enjoy work as a data analyst.
